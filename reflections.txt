   how to attract interface   

3. What two additional features did you build? Why?

4. Where do you still have room to grow?
   the way to abstract.
   the way of thinking of ruby is not the same as C++, now I am feel not good to work with it.I think I should study more of ruby.
   It seems does not have abstract interface, override.So how to abstract as C++, or is it a good way to think like c++.
   e.g.: @description in todoItem,eventItem, linkItem. Should I extract @description into a base class/interface ?
